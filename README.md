# URL Beheader
Hito 1 de IngenierÃ­a Web. (No voy a poner milestone porque me suena a piedra del Minecraft)

## Requierements
  * An interpreter/shell/terminal of any distribution that supports python (Pycharm can be also used)
  * Install all the requierements.txt in the terminal

## How it works
This API shortens URLs introduced by the user thanks to FastAPI's functions.

To run the app, we will use `uvicorn main:app --reload` (main refers to the file's .py name). Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (if this does not work, in the terminal it is specified where the API is being hosted).

By adding `/docs` at the end of the URL, the Swagger interface will show up. The Swagger's interface (which is very easy and intuitive to use) lets us try all the http methods available in the API.

This API consists of a pattern of `POST` and `GET` of URLs that gets stored in a temporary database, and dies when the app stops. The function of the temporary database is to not have more than one URL assignated to the same custom name, or more than one custom name assignated to the same URL. 

If a non-temporary database is added, it will be more efficient. However, this will not be implemented into this API, only to mantain its didactic function.

### Small Warning
>>>   This API IS NOT SUITED for a large quantity of URLs. We do not want, wherever the API is being hosted, to do 800 *for* iterations. It is bad for your health.
